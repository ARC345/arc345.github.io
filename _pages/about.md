I’m **Arnav Rastogi**, an AI researcher and engineer passionate about building intelligent systems that connect ideas from machine learning, reinforcement learning, and agentic AI.  

I’m currently pursuing MIT’s **MicroMasters in Data Science**, while also studying at **IIT Jodhpur**. My long-term goal is to contribute to research in AI/ML at the PhD level. My interests include **cellular automata, reinforcement learning, and general-purpose AI agents**.  

Outside of research and coding, I’m passionate about staying active and exploring the world:  
- I **work out regularly** and focus on strength and endurance.  
- I **played football competitively** and represented at the **national level**.
- I’m a **certified Advanced Open Water Diver**, exploring underwater ecosystems whenever I get the chance.

When I’m not coding or training, I enjoy connecting with smart peers, working on side projects that stretch beyond traditional boundaries, and learning new skills.
